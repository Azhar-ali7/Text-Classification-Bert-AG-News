# Text-Classification-Bert-AG-News
Using AG News Classification Dataset, the goal is to categorise text into various groups.
A machine learning model can be trained and evaluated using the dataset. This report aims to
describe the steps taken to prepare the dataset, the model's architecture, how it was tuned,
evaluation metrics, results, and suggestions for how to make the model work better.
